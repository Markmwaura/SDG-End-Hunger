            <aside class="one"><img class="one" src="images/happybelly.jpg" /></aside> Globally, one in nine people in the world today (795 million) are undernourished The vast majority of the world’s hungry people live in developing countries, where 12.9 per cent of the population is undernourished. Asia is the continent with the most hungry people – two thirds of the total. The percentage in southern Asia has fallen in recent years but in western Asia it has increased slightly. Southern Asia faces the greatest hunger burden, with about 281 million undernourished people. In sub-Saharan Africa, projections for the 2014-2016 period indicate a rate of undernourishment of almost 23 per cent. Poor nutrition causes nearly half (45 per cent) of deaths in children under five – 3.1 million children each year. One in four of the world’s children suffer stunted growth. In developing countries the proportion can rise to one in three. 66 million primary school-age children attend classes hungry across the developing world, with 23 million in Africa alone.

            Overall Health
            <br> The nutrients in the foods you eat support the activities of day-to-day living, protect your cells from environmental damage and repair any cellular damage that might occur. Protein rebuilds injured tissue and promotes a healthy immune system. Both carbohydrates and fats fuel your body, while vitamins and minerals function throughout your body in support of your body’s processes. Vitamins A, C and E, for example, act as antioxidants to protect your cells against toxins, and B vitamins help you extract energy from the foods you eat. Calcium and phosphorus keep your bones strong, while sodium and potassium help to transmit nerve signals. Without a healthy diet, you might compromise any of these essential functions.
            <br> Weight Control
            <br> In addition to the quality of the foods you consume, the quantity matters when considering good eating habits. Taking in the same number of calories as you burn ensures your weight remains steady over time. Consuming more than you burn, on the other hand, results in weight gain as your body converts extra calories to fat tissue. When you accumulate fat tissue, you increase your risk of developing one or more health problems, including heart disease, hypertension, respiratory issues, diabetes and cancer. A healthy meal plan without excess calories helps you not only feel better but can prolong your life.
            <br> Disease Prevention
            <br>Obesity is not the only nutrition-related cause of disease onset and progression. Too much or too little of certain nutrients can also contribute to health issues. For instance, a lack of calcium in your diet can predispose you to developing osteoporosis, or weakening of your bones, while too much saturated fat can cause cardiovascular disease, and too few fruits and vegetables in your nutrition plan is associated with an increased incidence of cancer. Consuming foods from a wide variety of sources helps ensure your body has the nutrients it needs to avoid these health problems.

            <br>Ways to Reduce Wasted Food
            <br> By simply making a list with weekly meals in mind, you can save money and time and eat healthier food. If you buy no more than what you expect to use, you will be more likely to keep it fresh and use it all.
            <br> Keep a running list of meals and their ingredients that your household already enjoys. That way, you can easily choose, shop for and prepare meals.
            <br> Make your shopping list based on how many meals you’ll eat at home. Will you eat out this week? How often?
            <br> Plan your meals for the week before you go shopping and buy only the things needed for those meals.
            <br> Include quantities on your shopping list noting how many meals you’ll make with each item to avoid overbuying. For example: salad greens - enough for two lunches.
            <br> Find out how to store fruits and vegetables so they stay fresh longer inside or outside your refrigerator.
            <br> Freeze, preserve, or can surplus fruits and vegetables - especially abundant seasonal produce.
            <br> Many fruits give off natural gases as they ripen, making other nearby produce spoil faster. Store bananas, apples, and tomatoes by themselves, and store fruits and vegetables in different bins.
            <br> Wait to wash berries until you want to eat them to prevent mold.
            <br> If you like to eat fruit at room temperature, but it should be stored in the refrigerator for maximum freshness, take what you’ll eat for the day out of the refrigerator in the morning.
            <br> When you get home from the store, take the time to wash, dry, chop, dice, slice, and place your fresh food items in clear storage containers for snacks and easy cooking.
            <br> Befriend your freezer and visit it often. For example, Freeze food such as bread, sliced fruit, or meat that you know you won’t be able to eat in time.
            <br> Cut your time in the kitchen by preparing and freezing meals ahead of time.
            <br> Shop in your refrigerator first! Cook or eat what you already have at home before buying more.
            <br> Have produce that’s past its prime? It may still be fine for cooking. Think soups, casseroles, stir fries, sauces, baked goods, pancakes or smoothies.

            <br> Improving efficiency in the use of resources is crucial to sustainable agriculture
            <br> Sustainability requires direct action to conserve, protect and enhance natural resources
            <br> Agriculture that fails to protect and improve rural livelihoods, equity and social well-being is unsustainable
            <br> Enhanced resilience of people, communities and ecosystems is key to sustainable agriculture
            <br> Sustainable food and agriculture requires responsible and effective governance mechanisms

            <br>EMERGENCIES:
            <br> A devastating hurricane, drought, health epidemic or political crisis can throw thousands of previously food secure families into chaos and hunger. Emergency programs get food assistance where it’s needed quickly to prevent widespread hunger and malnutrition.
            <br>SAFETY NETS:
            <br>Every household faces the risk of an interruption in its ability to afford sufficient, nutritious food caused by a sudden shock—for example, a lost job, poor harvest, or illness. Safety nets help families protect productive assets in the face of temporary hardship.
            <br>NUTRITION:
            <br> To grow and remain healthy, people need not just enough calories, but the right nutrients. This is especially true in the 1,000 Days between a woman’s pregnancy and the child’s second birthday.
            <br>AGRICULTURE:
            <br> Most hungry people rely on small-scale agriculture to make a living and feed their families. Research has consistently shown that investing in agriculture is more effective in reducing poverty among the poorest people than investments in other sectors.
